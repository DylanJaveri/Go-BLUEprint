        <div class="content" id="content1">
            <ul>
                <li>Jobs such as Investment Banking (IB), Accounting, Venture Capital (VC), Private Equity (PE), and much more all fall under the greater branch of Finance. A career in Finance can lead to a multitude of high-paying positions, varying based on chosen career path and expertise. Understanding your long-term career objectives may help clarify the advantages of each of these paths. Most broadly, paths in finance are often held in high esteem for lucrative salaries right out of college, which grow exponentially as you age while your working hours decline. While new analysts in IB, PE, or VC positions might be tasked with 100+ hour work weeks right out of college, many people look toward this inverse growth relationship between salary and working hours over time as a worthwhile investment in their own future. </li>
                <li>While Finance as a broader field includes a wide variety of career opportunities, the hierarchy of positions in specific fields of finance will often look the same. For example, the traditional path of ascension at the average IB firm will look something like this: fresh college graduates will enter the workforce as financial analysts, get promoted to Senior Financial Analysts after about 3 years, and then eventually hope to become Directors of Finance and then ultimately become Chief Financial Officers. (CFO) Similarly, becoming a CFO is often times viewed to be the top of the accounting hierarchy, although the path to reaching it is slightly different. After college, you could be hired as a payroll or bookkeeping accountant, get promoted to staff and then senior accountant, then become a senior accounting manager, and then finally reach a CFO position from there. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Venture Capital vs Private Equity vs Investment Banking: What’s the Difference?            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>When going through the process of recruiting finance, you will often hear these three fields being talked about tangentially. The reason for this is that at their core, they require a lot of the same skills and functions.  All 3 involve raising capital for their funds, and then investing that capital with the goal of making a significant return. They make money through these profits and also through charging fees. What separates them, mainly, is the type of investments that they make. While Investment Bankers will primarily invest in public stocks, commodities, and other financial products,  Venture Capitalists look to create large-scale returns by investing in startups and aiding them in their growth. Similarly, Private Equity firms will look at smaller startups as well, but with the goal of acquiring them in their entirety and turning them around how they see fit. The decision of which of these, if any, is best for you is mostly dictated by preference and interest, but some niche skills could vary and can be picked up through hands-on experience.                </li>

        <div class="content" id="content2">
            <ul>
                <li>In the case of most positions in finance, people entering the field tend to be those who feel themselves capable of working in relative solitude and should also be candidates with good quantitative reasoning skills. In order to continue to climb the ranks and grow within the structure of corporate finance, candidates should also be high on emotional intelligence and other people skills.                </li>
            <li>Work-Life Balance: Those planning to recruit for a position in finance should consider the tradeoff of early-life social freedom that comes with taking a job in finance. Most analysts will be expected to work 100+ hours a week, 7 days a week, right out of college. If this sounds like a major turnoff for you, it might be pertinent to reconsider if finance is the right path for you. If this sounds manageable and like something you might thrive within, it is a lot more likely that finance could be a viable career path for you.               </li>

In the second half of the course, we will discuss mergers and acquisitions, including LBOs. Throughout the course, there will be a focus on different valuation techniques, which we will apply both to capital raising and M&A scenarios. We will also discuss the bankruptcy process and distressed investing, as well as corporate governance.                 </p>
