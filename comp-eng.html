        <h1> Research </h1>
        <p class="page-simple-text"> There are two general pathways towards undergraduate research: the structured program or the initiative path. The structured program would either be UROP and SROP where the university would provide lectures about research and help students connect with professors. The issues with the structured program however is that many students rather directly connect with proffesors instead of going to the mandatory lectures. The initiative pathway would entail cold emailing professors that are partaking in research that seems interesting to the student; however, the likihood of getting a specific profesor is low and likely outcome is that out of 100 professors, one responds.</p>

        <h1> Career </h1>
        <p class="page-simple-text"> Generally speaking internships offers will be hard to recieve for a first year but nonetheless, the skills require to recieve an offer are vital to build. First step would be to do coding projects (ideally team based) that solve a problem or issue. Second step would be to build a resume using a template or layout - use this website for advice. Next, attend career fairs and meet companies that accept resumes and freshmen and apply to these and more companies online. If accepted, the student will have to complete a behavior and technical interview. To be successful at the technical interview, practice leetcode. Finally while this advice is for freshmen, for the next few years, create/update projects, update your resume, reach out to more companies and finally practice more leetcode.</p>
