            <p> Many students, particularly those early in their undergraduate journey or first-generation college students, often feel lost when it comes to securing competitive internships and applying to graduate schools. By the time they understand the requirements for fields like consulting, investment banking, and computer science, itâ€™s often too late to build the necessary network or gain relevant experience. </p>
            <br>
            <p> This website aims to bridge this gap by providing accessible resources for recruitment and graduate school applications, ensuring all students can navigate these processes effectively.</p>
