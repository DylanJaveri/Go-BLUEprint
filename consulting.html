            <p>Consulting is a field where experts help individuals or organizations solve problems. A consultant uses specialized knowledge to advise on diverse challenges—whether in management, technology, or strategy—to make businesses more efficient, effective, or better prepared for change. Management or tech consultants, for instance, focus on helping companies address specific business issues, from enhancing technology infrastructure to streamlining workflows or entering new markets.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consulting can seem broad, but it essentially involves experts offering tailored solutions to improve a company's operations. Consulting careers are rewarding, offering the chance to apply expertise meaningfully. While some consultants work in-house, many work externally, especially at large firms like EY, PwC, Deloitte, and KPMG, where they are assigned to various client projects.</li>
                <li>If you’re exploring consulting careers, a good starting point is to learn about different consulting roles, such as strategy or technology, and take a quiz to discover which path might suit you best.</li>
