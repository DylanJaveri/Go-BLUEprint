        <p class="page-simple-text">Choosing a major in Biopsychology, Cognition, and Neuroscience (BCN) can open the door to numerous career paths, each benefiting from a strong understanding of how the brain and mind work. This interdisciplinary major equips students with a comprehensive foundation in biology, psychology, and neuroscience, giving them the skills needed to thrive in a wide range of fields. Here’s what a BCN major can help students achieve:        </p>
        <ul class="page-simple-text">
            <li>Research Opportunities: A solid foundation in neuroscience and cognition prepares students to contribute to research projects in academic, clinical, or pharmaceutical settings. Understanding experimental design, data analysis, and laboratory techniques makes students competitive for research assistant roles and future graduate studies.</li>
            <li>Healthcare and Medicine: Students interested in becoming doctors, therapists, or other healthcare professionals benefit from the major's emphasis on the biological basis of behavior and mental health. It provides a valuable understanding of how the brain impacts physical and psychological health, useful for careers like neurology, psychiatry, or neuropsychology.</li>
            <li>Clinical and Counseling Roles: Those aiming for careers in psychology or mental health counseling can build a deep understanding of cognitive and emotional processes. This background is ideal for working in therapy, rehabilitation, or counseling settings where knowledge of brain-behavior relationships is essential.            </li>
            <li>Education and Advocacy: Students interested in science education or public health can leverage their understanding of biopsychology to teach and advocate for mental health awareness, neuroscience literacy, and wellness education.            </li>
            <li>Graduate Studies: With a BCN major, students are well-prepared for pursuing graduate degrees in fields like neuroscience, psychology, public health, or even law, particularly in areas that intersect with cognitive science and mental health.            </li>
