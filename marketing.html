            <ul>
                <li>Students interested in pursuing an Entrepreneurial Venture, General Management, or just running their own business may want to consider Marketing. A career in Marketing, which requires many of the same skills as a General Manager, can prepare an individual for a future entrepreneurial experience. Understanding your long-term career objectives may help clarify the advantages of each of these paths. </li>
                <li>Marketing includes a wide variety of career opportunities which will be discussed later in this guide. Due to the multitude of opportunities, professional titles and specific roles in the field may vary, depending on the organization. For example, at some companies, the title comparable to "Brand Manager" may be "Product Manager," or the "Business Development" position at one place may be comparable to "Sales" at another. </li>
                <li> Product and Brand Management functions in all industries use General Management and Marketing skills to oversee the development of a product or service throughout the various stages of its life cycle. The job of a Marketer is to essentially keep the product or service alive and thriving in the market. </li>

        <div class="content" id="content2">
            <ul>
                <li>Regardless of the specific marketing position, there are some basic skills and interests Marketing professionals should possess. Marketers ultimately enjoy leading a process from start to finish. Marketing managers 'own' their product or service and essentially run a small business, so entrepreneurial interest is a positive trait. Marketing professionals have higher creative interests than most operating managers, and are effective at communicating with various stakeholders in an organization. They equally enjoy the financials of the business as well as the creative aspects. In addition, marketing careers call for a strong interest in managing people, as many marketing efforts are team-oriented</li>
                <li>Work Life Balance: Marketing professionals can expect a diverse, dynamic work experience, with new challenges emerging each day. The workload may fluctuate; for example, during marketing plan development, workweeks typically range from 50-70 hours, followed by slower periods -- it all depends on what the product or brand needs. Marketers can typically expect a positive work-life balance as compared to other functions such as Consulting or Banking. </li>
                <li>The main skills of a good Marketer revolve around analytical ability and creativity. Many students are intimidated by the "creative" aspect of Marketing because many equate it to artistic ability, which is rarely the case. Creativity in Marketing is the ability to use tools and resources provided to satisfy business objectives. For example, if the objective is to increase sales and awareness for a new brand, but there is limited advertising and promotion spend, the Marketer must use creative thinking to solve this problem. In this case, the Marketer can employ retailer-specific promotions to effectively use promotion dollars, and connect with an influencer to maximize advertising dollars.</li>
                <li>Am I willing to work long hours and manage the demands of travel or frequent project changes?</li>
                <li>Does the idea of working across diverse industries and continuously learning excite me?</li>
                <li>What specific type of consulting aligns with my strengths and interests (e.g., strategy, technology, management)?</li>

                <li>It is much more analytical than people think. While creativity is important, make sure to emphasize your analytical/ data analysis skills as well</li>
                <li>Networking is key for marketing! Make sure to focus on this a decent amount </li>

                <li>A lot of Marketing Positions are rolling</li>
                <li>It is better to apply early, because a lot of these companies can end up closing their applications early once they receive too many applications                 </li>
                <li>The earlier the better!                </li>
